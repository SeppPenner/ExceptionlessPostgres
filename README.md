ExceptionlessPostgres
====================================

This project's aim was to support [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) in
[Exceptionless](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless). However, after looking through the code,
it's very complicated.
Therefore, my new re-write of [Exceptionless](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless),
[ExceptionLesser](https://github.com/SeppPenner/ExceptionLesser) will be able to use multiple databases using
[Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) and [Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor).
